                <p>to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects.

                <p>when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.

                    He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
                    
                    The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.
